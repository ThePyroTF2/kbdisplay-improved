## Goals

[Nohboard](https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard) is great! But it's only for Windows. The only alternative is [Tiyenti's KBDisplay](https://github.com/Tiyenti/kbdisplay), which is really great, but limited in functionality. My primary goal with this project is to replicate the functionality of NohBoard in a Linux-compatible manner. More specifically, I want to be able to feed in any NohBoard config file and have near-identical output to NohBoard.

I may add functionality where I think it would fit, but I want to prioritize interoperability with NohBoard. Call it just another incentive for gamers to switch to Linux.
